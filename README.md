![Unknown](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b06b6d3b-d1ca-4c99-84fa-9f5631e51a4a)

Welcome to the Mercedes-Benz Car Price Prediction project! This repository showcases my journey through data science, where I analyze and predict the prices of used Mercedes-Benz cars using advanced machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates the power of data to unlock valuable insights in the automotive industry.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of pre-owned Mercedes-Benz vehicles based on various features such as manufacturing year, mileage, engine size, and more. By leveraging the power of data science, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence car prices and make informed predictions.


**Key Features:**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover key patterns and relationships in the dataset.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Feature Engineering:** Transform and optimize features for better model performance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Machine Learning Model:** Build and evaluate a Random Forest Regressor to predict car prices.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Feature Importance:** Identify the most influential factors driving the price predictions.<br>

## Technologies Used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Python:** The core language used for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For data visualization.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data exploration and model development.<br>

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase focuses on understanding the dataset by exploring relationships between variables, identifying outliers, and visualizing distributions. Key insights include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Price Distribution:** Analyzing how car prices are distributed across different models and years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Year vs. Price:** Exploring the correlation between a car's manufacturing year and its price.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Feature Correlations:** Understanding which features are most strongly associated with price.<br>

## Machine Learning Model
A Random Forest Regressor was selected for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets with multiple features. The model was trained and evaluated, achieving the following results:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 2066.02<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 3925.80<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•**R-squared (R²):** 0.9013<br>

## Feature Importance
The model's feature importance analysis reveals the top contributors to price prediction, such as manufacturing year, mileage, and engine size.

## Results & Insights
The model provides accurate predictions of car prices, which can be used by dealerships, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions. Key takeaways include:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Newer cars with lower mileage and larger engines tend to be priced higher.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•The model's high R² score demonstrates its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of the pricing structure.

## Future Work
Potential future enhancements include:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Integrating more features (e.g., car color, location).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Deploying the model as a web application for real-time price predictions.<br>
